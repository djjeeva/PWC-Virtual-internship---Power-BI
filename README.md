# PWC-Virtual-internship---Power-BI
In our rapidly evolving digital world, there's a pressing need to build new skills. This isn't just about digital literacy; it also involves enhancing our digital awareness, emotional intelligence, and creativity to thrive in future workplaces.

I recently completed the Power BI module of the PwC Digital Accelerator program. This initiative is part of PwC's global effort to upskill its workforce and prepare them for the challenges of the digital age. The program helps participants like me deepen our expertise in digital specialties such as data analysis, automation, AI, and digital storytelling by using various self-service tools and coding languages.

With guidance from my manager, Giulia, I undertook a Power BI project that involved visualizing data for a key client. This project allowed me to put my new skills into practice and gain hands-on experience in data visualization and analysis.

You can check out my Power BI project and see the skills I've acquired by visiting my GitHub repository here.
